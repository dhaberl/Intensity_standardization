# Intensity standardization
 Scaling intensities to a common standard scale.

## How to use
```

```

## Acknowledgements
Implementation based on:
- https://github.com/sergivalverde/MRI_intensity_normalization
- https://github.com/jcreinhold/intensity-normalization
- https://gitlab.com/eferrante/nyul/-/tree/c01ad9afc89e9de18cd5ff911877bcbf49777476

It is suggested to use one of those packages for (brain) MRI scans, since they support NIfTI file format.
